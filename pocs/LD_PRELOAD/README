This directory contains an old POC of how to run interception with
LD_PRELOAD. Nothing fancy, actually.



Try :
	make
	./programme

The program returns "Fonction qui sera hookee"

Now try
	./ld_preload.sh
The program returns "reecriture reussie !"

NOTE: doesn't work if there's an end of line \n at the end of the printf in the program
