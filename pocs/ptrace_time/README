This is an attempt at ptracing gettimeofday. That's not very
sucessful, as we need to pass the following parameters to the linux
boot line:

  vdso=0 vsyscall=native

This is because otherwise, gettimeofday is not a syscall but uses the
VDSO trick so that the application can retrieve the time without any
syscall. Passing these parameters is rather intrusive (it will
probably slow down your unrelated applications).


But once you've done that, you can then run:

  ./timetravel multiplying_factor temps
