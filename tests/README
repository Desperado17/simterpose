Here are some tests for simterpose. Nothing automatic yet, but the
provided scripts start the simulation with all the needed parameters.

apps/	 	       	   The little applications used in tests

send_clientserver.sh:	   Client/server app using send / recv       (works)
 		       	   Useless because send and recv syscalls are not yet
		       	   implemented
sendto_clientserver.sh:	   Client/server app using sendto / recvfrom
			   (doesn't work)
msg_clientserver.sh:	   Client/server app using sendmsg / recvmsg (works)

fcntl_little.sh: 	   Fcntl syscall test file
 			   (works except the two last tests)
fcntl_big.sh:		   Idem
sys_file.sh:		   Test file system syscalls
 			   (read/write, open/close, creat, fcntl, lseek,
			   dup/dup2)

time.sh:		   File to test interception of time functions by
			   LD_PRELOAD


allpairs.sh:               Simterpose test using allpair, but it's not
			   working yet
allpair/                   Usecase of allpair
python-pp.sh:              another ongoing try
