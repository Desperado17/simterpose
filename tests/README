Here are some tests for simterpose. Nothing automatic yet, but the
provided scripts start the simulation with all the needed parameters.

 apps/                  The little applications used in tests

 send_clientserver.sh:  Client/server app using send / recv       (should works)
 msg_clientserver.sh    Client/server app using sendmsg / recvmsg (kinda works)

 allpairs.sh:           Simterpose test using allpair, but it's not working yet
 allpair/               Usecase of allpair
