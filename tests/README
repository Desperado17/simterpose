Here are some tests for simterpose. Nothing automatic yet, but the
provided scripts start the simulation with all the needed parameters.

 apps/                  The little applications used in tests

 send_clientserver.sh:  Client/server app using send / recv       (works)
 msg_clientserver.sh:   Client/server app using sendmsg / recvmsg (works)
 fcntl_little.sh: 	Fcntl syscall test file (works except the two last tests)
 fcntl_big.sh:		Idem


 allpairs.sh:           Simterpose test using allpair, but it's not working yet
