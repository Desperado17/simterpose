To be able to trace gettimeofday, we need to disable vdso and vsyscall:

vdso=0 vsyscall=native

then run ./ptrace temps
doesn't work

found a timetravel example on the web but since it's linear we can't see the difference (as we compute final time - begin time), need to be modified. If we multiply by a scalar 'a' we don't actually have a dilatation of the time by a (gettimeofday does not return seconds)

also there seem to be carry issues between sec & usec
