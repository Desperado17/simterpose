To compil program
	make

To run program
	sudo ./run_trace [-p flops_power] platform_file deployment_file [--log=root.app:file:logfile.txt]
or because of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable: ./run.sh

 /!\ TASKSTATS_CMD_GET in ask_time (calc_time_proc.c) seems to require to be root /!\ 

To replay trace
	disabled for a while
