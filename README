Simterpose aims at simulating distributed applications. For this purpose, 
it intercepts all system calls made by the set of application.

Requirements:
	- SimGrid (tested with 3.11)
	- linux (this application will never work on non-POSIX platform)

Compiling Simterpose:
	make

Running Simterpose: (as root because of cputimer_get())
	./run.sh (client/server example with sendto/recvfrom syscalls)
	./run_sendmsg.sh (example with sendmsg/recvmsg syscalls)
	
Other simulations (currently not working)
  * ./allpairs_run.sh (simulation of allpairs, requires: http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/allpairs/)
  * ./pp_run.sh (simulation of pp python, requires the python-pp package)
  * Trace replay is currently disabled because not working.

	
GENERAL USE:

  Like SimGrid, Simterpose uses a platform file and a deployment file,
  both in XML. Please see the SimGrid 101s for more information.
  
  simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/simgrid-101.pdf
  simgrid.gforge.inria.fr/tutorials/simgrid-use-101.pdf

  Simterpose uses the deployment file to know which (real) program
  should be launched on which (virtual) hosts, and with which
  parameters.


WARNING:

  This is a pre-version of Simterpose, that is not ready for use in
  production settings. Some things are not perfectly working while
  other things are still to be implemented.
