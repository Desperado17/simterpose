SimTerpose aims at simulating distributed applications. For this purpose, 
it intercepts all system calls made by the set of application.

Requirements:
	- SimGrid > 3.11 (previous releases not tested, xml parser changes since 
	3.6.2)

To compile SimTerpose:
	make

To run SimTerpose:
	./run.sh (client/server example with sendto/recvfrom syscalls)
	./run_sendmsg.sh (example with sendmsg/recvmsg syscalls)
 /!\ TASKSTATS_CMD_GET in cputimer.c::cputimer_get() seems to require to be 
 root /!\ 	
	
Other simulations (doesn't work for now)
	./allpairs_run.sh (simulation of allpairs, needs to be installed: 
	http://ccl.cse.nd.edu/software/allpairs/)
	./pp_run.sh (simulation of pp python. python-pp package needs to be 
	installed)

Trace replay:
	disabled for a while
	
GENERAL USE:

Like SimGrid, SimTerpose uses a deployment file and a platform file, in XML 
format. The deployment file is used to give SimTerpose the processes as well as 
their arguments and the host on which they run. The platform file describes 
both the resources and the topology. We put information about the hosts, their
computing power and the links between the different nodes.


WARNING:

This version of SimTerpose is delivered without any warranty, it's a development 
version and several things are not implemented yet.
