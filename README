Simterpose aims at simulating distributed applications. For this purpose, 
it intercepts all system calls made by the set of application and
replay them within the SimGrid framework.

Requirements:
	- SimGrid (tested with 3.11)
	- A modern Linux kernel on an AMD64 machine.

Compiling Simterpose:
	cmake .
	make

Running Simterpose: (as root because of cputimer_get())
	Please check the launcher scripts in tests/ to get an idea of
        how to launch simterpose (you must be root to do so).
	
GENERAL USE:

  Like SimGrid, Simterpose uses a platform file and a deployment file,
  both in XML. Please see the SimGrid 101s for more information.

  Simterpose uses the deployment file to know which (real) program
  should be launched on which (virtual) hosts, and with which
  parameters.


WARNING:

  This is a pre-version of Simterpose, that is not ready for use in
  production settings. Some things are not perfectly working while
  other things are still to be implemented.
